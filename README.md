# PushSwap


PushSwap is a sorting algorithm project that efficiently sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions.

## Overview

PushSwap employs a combination of sorting algorithms and optimization techniques to arrange a given stack of integers in ascending order. The project aims to demonstrate an understanding of algorithmic complexity and problem-solving skills.

### Key Features

- **Efficient Sorting**: PushSwap implements algorithms optimized for minimal moves to efficiently sort large stacks of integers.
- **Visualization**: The project includes visualization tools to illustrate the sorting process, aiding in understanding and debugging.
- **Customizable**: Users can customize the sorting algorithm and parameters based on the size and characteristics of the input stack.

## Installation

To install PushSwap, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:Sebrani-Aymane/push_swap42.git
  Navigate to the project directory:

bash
   cd pushswap

Compile the code:

bash

    make

Usage

To use PushSwap, execute the binary with a list of integers as input. For example:

bash

./push_swap 4 2 7 1

This will output a series of instructions to sort the given list of integers.
Algorithm Overview

PushSwap utilizes various sorting algorithms, including insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort, based on the size and characteristics of the input stack. Additionally, it employs optimization techniques such as pre-sorting and intelligent move selection to minimize the number of operations required.
Visualization

PushSwap provides visualization tools to aid in understanding the sorting process. Users can visualize the stack and each step of the sorting algorithm to analyze its behavior and efficiency.
